    <h1>History and other information</h1> 
Who developed or discovered it? What is some information about the development?
ATP was first discovered by Karl Lohmann, who also established its structure a few years later. It was first synthesized by Alexander Todd.
What is it used for?
ATP is the chemical form of energy used by cells of organisms. The molecules of sugars that enter the cells through the bloodstream are processed and turned into ATP with the help of oxygen and water. When the energy is released, the part of the cell that is using the ATP breaks apart one of the phosphorous-oxygen groups, breaking the bonds and releasing the energy. Once all of the groups are broken, the ATP is “spent” and is now ADP (adenosine diphosphate).
